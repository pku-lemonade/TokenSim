"""O(log n) free-block queue replacing linear deque scans.

The previous implementation kept one deque mixing uncached (FIFO) and cached
(sorted by ``last_accessed`` via linear scan + insert) blocks; membership
checks, removals, and sorted inserts were all O(queue length), which dominated
runtime at HBF-scale block counts. This structure keeps the same eviction
intent — uncached blocks are handed out first, then cached blocks in
least-recently-accessed order — with O(1)/O(log n) operations.

Known (accepted) drift vs. the old mixed deque: previously an uncached block
appended *after* a cached block could be popped after it; now uncached blocks
are always preferred before evicting any cached block.
