    Block objects are materialized lazily: never-used blocks exist only as the
    ``_next_fresh`` counter. At HBF-scale capacities (hundreds of thousands of
    blocks per worker) eagerly building one Python object per block dominated
    startup time and added a large constant RSS term. Hand-out order matches
    the eager implementation: fresh ids in ascending order first, then
    recycled uncached blocks (FIFO), then cached blocks in LRU order.
